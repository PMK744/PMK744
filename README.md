## Howdy Folks! ðŸ‘‹
Hello my name is Payton Kerby and I am a software developer located in small town Okarche, Oklahoma. I am currently attending Redlands Community College for my associates degree, then I will be attending the University of Central Oklahoma to achive a degree in Computer Science and majoring in Software Engineering.

## What do I know?
I am still new to coding, I have been coding for roughly 4 years now, and I find myself coding more backend related software than frontend. I love to explore and try new languages and technologies to keep myself busy.
